You have 24 hours to resolve each of the following questions we are setting.
You have time to resolve as much as you can.
You have to resolve every question with coding because you are going to be a programmer.

Please answer every question using tech stacks you are applied to:

1. If you are done with your task. You must push them all in the public git repository. Must push, not upload. Pushing code by following git flow standard.
2. Also with the conventions, every answer you made, each must have a standalone folder with name Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 and push them in one repository
3. Donâ€™t ever push them in compressed format like .zip, .rar. .gzip, etc.
4. Every folder of the answer must be a runnable/executable application when we `cd` to the directory.
5. Every folder of the answer must have a README.md explaining what it is.

You are The Best, Good luck!
